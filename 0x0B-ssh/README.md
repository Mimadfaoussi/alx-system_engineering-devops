    <h1>Along with this project</h1>
    <p>
        You have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, you will connect using ssh. But contrary to level 2, you will not connect using a password but an RSA key. We’ve configured your server with the public key you created in the first task of a previous project shared in your intranet profile.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can access your server information in the my servers section of the intranet, each line with contains the IP and username you should use to connect via ssh.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Your server is configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.</p>
