     ssccpp copies files between hosts on a network.

     It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and
     provides the same security as a login session.

     ssccpp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authen‐
     tication.

     The _s_o_u_r_c_e and _t_a_r_g_e_t may be specified as a local pathname, a remote host
     with optional path in the form [user@]host:[path], or a URI in the form
     scp://[user@]host[:port][/path].  Local file names can be made explicit
     using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid ssccpp treating file names
     containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.

     When copying between two remote hosts, if the URI format is used, a _p_o_r_t
     cannot be specified on the _t_a_r_g_e_t if the --RR option is used.

     The options are as follows:

     --33      Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local
             host.  Without this option the data is copied directly between
             the two remote hosts.  Note that, when using the original SCP
             protocol (the default), this option selects batch mode for the
             second host as ssccpp cannot ask for passwords or passphrases for
             both hosts.  This mode is the default.

     --44      Forces ssccpp to use IPv4 addresses only.

     --66      Forces ssccpp to use IPv6 addresses only.

     --AA      Allows forwarding of ssh-agent(1) to the remote system.  The de‐
             fault is not to forward an authentication agent.

     --BB      Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
             passphrases).

     --CC      Compression enable.  Passes the --CC flag to ssh(1) to enable com‐
             pression.

     --cc _c_i_p_h_e_r
             Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This
             option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     --DD _s_f_t_p___s_e_r_v_e_r___p_a_t_h
             When using the SFTP protocol support via --ss, connect directly to
             a local SFTP server program rather than a remote one via ssh(1).
             This option may be useful in debugging the client and server.

     --FF _s_s_h___c_o_n_f_i_g
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for sssshh.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     --ii _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y___f_i_l_e
             Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public
             key authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to
             ssh(1).

     --JJ _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n
             Connect to the target host by first making an ssccpp connection to
             the jump host described by _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n and then establishing a
             TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.  Multiple
             jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters.  This
             is a shortcut to specify a PPrrooxxyyJJuummpp configuration directive.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     --ll _l_i_m_i_t
             Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.

     --OO      Use the original SCP protocol for file transfers instead of the
             SFTP protocol.  Forcing the use of the SCP protocol may be neces‐
             sary for servers that do not implement SFTP, for backwards-com‐
             patibility for particular filename wildcard patterns and for ex‐
             panding paths with a ‘~’ prefix for older SFTP servers.  This
             mode is the default.

     --oo _s_s_h___o_p_t_i_o_n
             Can be used to pass options to sssshh in the format used in
             ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for which
             there is no separate ssccpp command-line flag.  For full details of
             the options listed below, and their possible values, see
             ssh_config(5).

     --PP _p_o_r_t
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that
             this option is written with a capital ‘P’, because --pp is already
             reserved for preserving the times and mode bits of the file.

     --pp      Preserves modification times, access times, and file mode bits
             from the source file.

     --qq      Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and
             diagnostic messages from ssh(1).

     --RR      Copies between two remote hosts are performed by connecting to
             the origin host and executing ssccpp there.  This requires that ssccpp
             running on the origin host can authenticate to the destination
             host without requiring a password.

     --rr      Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that ssccpp follows sym‐
             bolic links encountered in the tree traversal.

     --SS _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
             Name of _p_r_o_g_r_a_m to use for the encrypted connection.  The program
             must understand ssh(1) options.

     --ss      Use the SFTP protocol for transfers rather than the original scp
             protocol.

     --TT      Disable strict filename checking.  By default when copying files
             from a remote host to a local directory ssccpp checks that the re‐
             ceived filenames match those requested on the command-line to
             prevent the remote end from sending unexpected or unwanted files.
             Because of differences in how various operating systems and
             shells interpret filename wildcards, these checks may cause
             wanted files to be rejected.  This option disables these checks
             at the expense of fully trusting that the server will not send
             unexpected filenames.

     --vv      Verbose mode.  Causes ssccpp and ssh(1) to print debugging messages
             about their progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection,
             authentication, and configuration problems.

     The ssccpp utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     ssccpp is based on the rcp program in BSD source code from the Regents of
     the University of California.

     The original SCP protocol (used by default) requires execution of the re‐
     mote user's shell to perform glob(3) pattern matching.  This requires
     careful quoting of any characters that have special meaning to the remote
     shell, such as quote characters.
